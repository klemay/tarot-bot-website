        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>A light-skinned figure is depicted from the shoulders up, with their face partially obscured by the deep, dark blue background. Their eyes are purple and pink and they have a solemn expression on their face. Four swords hang above their head, pointing straight down, and four swords sit at their shoulders, two on each, pointing downward as well. The swords have pastel blue hilts with a yellow stripe.</p>
        <h3>Key words</h3>
        <p><span class="bold">Upright:</span> self-victimization, confinement, limitation</p>
        <p><span class="bold">Reversed:</span> liberation, awakening, openness to change</p>
      </div>

      <h3>Reflection questions</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Where in my life do I feel stuck or limited?</li>
        <li>How can I create more freedom and autonomy in my life?</li>
        <li>How can I challenge and reframe negative thoughts about myself?</li>

        <h3>Eight of Swords Upright</h3>
        <p>You’re feeling trapped, perhaps even victimized. The bad news is that you’re in a prison of your own making. The good news is that you can escape if you choose to do so. You’ll need to see beyond your currently limited perspective, and if you’re stubbornly refusing help from others, you’ll want to rethink that staunch independence.</p>

      <h3>Eight of Swords Reversed</h3>
      <p>Difficult times are behind you as a direct result of your actions. You’ve done the hard work of challenging your beliefs and letting go of the ones that do not serve you. Being open to change means allowing for the possibility of new opportunities and a sense of liberation.</p>
