        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>A light-skinned person with long blonde hair wearing a pastel pink dress sings into a microphone made out of a pink tulip. Vines grow out of the microphone and bright green leaves are sent flying everywhere as the person sings. The person has a joyful expression on their face. The sky is bright blue.</p>
        <h3>Key words</h3>
        <p><span class="bold">Upright:</span> courage, determination, joy, authenticity</p>
        <p><span class="bold">Reversed:</span> introversion, passivity, lacking confidence</p>

        <h3>Queen of Wands Upright</h3>
        <p>The Queen of Wands is an energetic, self-assured person who is not afraid to be themselves. They can be quick to anger, but they know where their strengths lie and are honest about where their skills are lacking. They are nurturing and a natural leader, and people are drawn to their enthusiasm. They are well-liked and they inspire others to work hard and be creative. This person could represent you or someone in your life. The Queen of Wands reminds you to be honest with yourself and others about what you want.</p>

      <h3>Queen of Wands Reversed</h3>
      <p>The Queen of Wands in reverse represents someone who has a hard time articulating their desires and vision. They might be hiding parts of themselves as a result of self-consciousness. Since the court cards can represent you or someone in your life, you might be dealing with someone who is overbearing, or you could be the overbearing one. Get a clear sense of what you want and how to proceed. Stand up for yourself, but don’t steamroll others.</p>
